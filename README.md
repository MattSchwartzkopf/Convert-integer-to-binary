# Convert-integer-to-binary
This code converts integer numbers into 4-bit binary. This is a question I had been given during an interview and thought I'd take my time to solve it properly to better develop my skills.

## For Example:
###### 12 -> {1, 2} -> 0001 0010
###### 35 -> {3, 5} -> 0011 0101
###### 769 -> {7, 6, 9} -> 0111 0110 1001
